# Irish-Flower-Class-Recognition
It is my first Machine Learning Project.
The data set is been taken from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/
The above project is based on KNN Algorithm.
KNN algorithm is used for get the nearest k train datasets, and among them if searches for voting and then get the maximum voted target variable as the perdiction.
It works perfectly in above case with a accuracy of 93.33%
From the given link, I get 150 datas, and I make it two parts, which is a basic step for every Machine Learning Model. I cerated a train data set of 120 datas and remaining 30 datas I used to test the model.
